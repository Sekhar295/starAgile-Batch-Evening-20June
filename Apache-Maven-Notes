Apache MAVEN:
==================
1. Maven is build automation tool 
2. It is a very powerful tool that can be used to build java code
3. Maven consist of various plugins to help us perform build automation steps
4. In order compile the code, test the code and package the code or review the code we use maven plugins 
5. There are almost 40 to 45 plugins in maven however we require only 5 plugins for our build process
6. It also can automatically download dependencies required for developer to write the code and test cases
7. Maven output files will always be available in a folder called as target
8. Maven is a command line tool, its does not have any GUI
9. maven gives us plugins and their commands which when run performs the required build steps

TASK to be performed             Plugin               COMMAND/GOAL                OUTPUT
======================================================================================================================
1. Compile the code              COMPILER             mvn compile                 compiled files - .class files 
2. Test the code                 SUREFIRE             mvn test                    junit testing reports   
3. Package the code              PACKAGE              mvn package                 artifact - .war,.jar files
4. Install dependencies          install              mvn install                 install any pending dependencies or libraries
5. Review code                    pmd                 mvn pmd:pmd                 code review report - pmd.xml
6. Code Coverage                 JACOCO               no command                  Coverage report 
7. Clean target folder           clean                mvn clean                   cleans up maven target folder 



Ever maven java project given by developer has a file called as pom.xml
It is heart of maven 
This file is updated with details by the developer 
if this file is not present, you cannot run any maven commands 
This file consists of:
- Name of the artifact 
- type of artifact 
- dependencies 
- plugins
